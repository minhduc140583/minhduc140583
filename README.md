## ðŸ’¼ Work
With my co-contributors, I created [core-go](https://github.com/core-go) and [core-ts](https://github.com/core-ts), which cover these areas:

### Database
- Simplify common database operations, such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, batch processing and transactions (for [SQL](https://github.com/core-go/sql)), by providing high-level abstractions and utilities.
- Generic CRUD Repository
    - It is like [CrudRepository](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html) of Spring, which promotes rapid development and consistency across applications.
    - While it provides many advantages, such as reducing boilerplate code and ensuring transactional integrity, it also offers flexibility and control over complex queries.
- My batis for GOLANG, nodejs
  - Project sample is at [go-admin](https://github.com/project-samples/go-admin). Mybatis file is here [query.xml](https://github.com/project-samples/go-admin/blob/main/configs/query.xml)
- Support:
    - [SQL](https://github.com/core-go/sql). The sample is at [go-sql-generic-sample](https://github.com/source-code-template/go-sql-generic-sample).
    - [Mongo](https://github.com/core-go/mongo). The sample is at [go-mongo-generic-sample](https://github.com/source-code-template/go-mongo-generic-sample).
    - [Cassandra](https://github.com/core-go/cassandra). The sample is at [go-cassandra-sample](https://github.com/source-code-template/go-cassandra-sample).
    - [Firestore](https://github.com/core-go/firestore). The sample is at [go-firestore-sample](https://github.com/go-tutorials/go-firestore-sample).
    - [Elastic Search](https://github.com/core-go/elasticsearch). The sample is at [go-elastic-search-generic-sample](https://github.com/source-code-template/go-elastic-search-generic-sample).
    - [Hive](https://github.com/core-go/hive). The sample is at [go-hive-sample](https://github.com/go-tutorials/go-hive-sample).
    - [Dynamodb](https://github.com/core-go/dynamodb). The sample is at [go-dynamodb-tutorial](https://github.com/go-tutorials/go-dynamodb-tutorial).

### Data Processing
Visit [core-go/io](https://github.com/core-go/io), you can see rich data processing:
- Import data from CSV or fix-length format files to [SQL](https://github.com/core-go/sql), [Mongo](https://github.com/core-go/mongo), [Cassandra](https://github.com/core-go/cassandra), [Firestore](https://github.com/core-go/firestore), [Elastic Search](https://github.com/core-go/elasticsearch), [Hive](https://github.com/core-go/hive)
- Export data from [SQL](https://github.com/project-samples/go-sql-export), [Mongo](https://github.com/project-samples/go-mongo-export), [Cassandra](https://github.com/project-samples/go-cassandra-export), [Firestore](https://github.com/project-samples/go-firestore-export), [Hive](https://github.com/project-samples/go-hive-export) to CSV or fix-length format files

- Because message queues are a crucial component in modern software architecture, we support most of message queues, such as [Kafka](https://github.com/project-samples/go-kafka-sample), [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/project-samples/go-rabbit-mq-sample), [IBMMQ](https://github.com/project-samples/go-ibm-mq-sample), [Active MQ](https://github.com/project-samples/go-active-mq-sample), [NATS](https://github.com/project-samples/go-nats-sample), [Google Pub/Sub](https://github.com/project-samples/go-pubsub-sample), [Amazon SQS](https://github.com/project-samples/go-amazon-sqs-sample).
- Support 2 levels of 7 message queues:
    - Standardize and simplify 7 message queues, for 9 libraries [rabbitmq/amqp091-go](https://github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go), [aws-sdk-go/service/sqs](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/tree/main/service/sqs), [go/pubsub](https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go/pubsub), [ibmmq](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-golang), [ActiveMQ](https://github.com/go-stomp/stomp), [nats.go](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.go), [segmentio/kafka-go](https://github.com/segmentio/kafka-go), [IBM/sarama](https://github.com/IBM/sarama) and [Confluent](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go).
    - Support standard level, which share the same interface with all message queues
        - Abstract the consumer flow
        - Support dead letter queue
    - Support SDK or original library level, you can use all advance features of the SDK/libraries
